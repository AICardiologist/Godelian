Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to Gödelian incompleteness using higher category theory and topos theory. We construct a hierarchy of (∞,1)-categories modeling increasingly powerful formal systems, and prove a generalized incompleteness theorem in this context. Using techniques from homotopy type theory, we develop a topos-theoretic model of metamathematical reasoning that captures subtle aspects of incompleteness phenomena. Our results have implications for the foundations of mathematics and theoretical computer science.
